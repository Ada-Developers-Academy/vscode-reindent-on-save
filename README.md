# Reindenter #

A simple VSCode formatter extension that wraps `editor.action.reindentlines`.

This allows things like formatting on save and "Format Document".

Based on example code by [jrieken]( https://github.com/jrieken/vscode-formatter-sample).

This extension is language agnostic.  So long as your language extension has indentation rules this should work for you.

Tested against VS Code 1.35.1
